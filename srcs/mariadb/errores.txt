1️⃣ Why your current Dockerfile fails

ENTRYPOINT ["mariadb"]

mariadb is the client, not the server.

That’s why when you run the container, there’s no server running → the socket /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock doesn’t exist → you get ERROR 2002 (HY000).

You need to start mysqld, the server, instead.

// Por que no lanzar el servidor de mariadb y el cliente de mariadb a la vez en el container:

In a container, you generally want only the server running, because:

- The container itself is meant to be the database service.

- Other programs (WordPress, Adminer, or docker exec … mariadb) will connect to it when needed.

- If you try to launch both server + client in one container, one of them has to stay in the foreground as PID 1 — but only one process can be the container’s “main process”.

You could technically script it (like mysqld & mariadb -u root) but:

- It goes against Docker best practices (one main service per container).

- The client would just sit there waiting for input, serving no real purpose.

- It makes your container harder to manage.
